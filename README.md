# Matrix-completion-over-graphs

The aim of matrix completion is to find the values given a few of its entries. This is a topic of interest since Candes' article
a few years ago. The aim of our project is to perform some matrix completion using a innovative graph-based approach. 
Graph theory is the current biggest topic in data science and machine learning as many social media and web communities provide large-
scale graphs and one wants to be able to build recommender systems.
We start describing the main principles of matrix completion on graphs, then we present a toy example simulating a synthetic netflix 
dataset in order to build a simplified recommender system.
